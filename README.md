# PokedexProject
A simple project to learn about Angular 8 and consuming data with [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).
This pokedex shows only first generation pokemons and it's static for now.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Deploy
The project is deployed on github [HERE](https://thaisgo.github.io/pokedex-project/pokedex-project)

## Status
The project is still in development status and I intend to add some more features and fix some problems.
- [] Create modal component to display pokemon infos
- [] Fix width of the main page
- [] Add card animation
- [] Create pagination component
